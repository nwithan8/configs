# This blueprint allows you to map actions to the different controls on an Aqara H1 Rotary Dial (https://homekitnews.com/2020/11/02/aqara-reveal-smart-rotary-dimmer-switch/)
#
# This ZigBee device is not currently supported by ZHA, and requires a custom ZHA quirk: https://gist.github.com/oxc/754d6436ce62d92af660d3671acd9346
# This ZigBee device is already supported by Z2M: https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers/issues/2266
#
# This automation is built for a device in EVENT mode rather than COMMAND mode. As there is some cross-over between the two modes, it is NOT recommended to use automations for both modes at the same time.
